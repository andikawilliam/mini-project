# Thoughts

### Status
- Backend & Frontend runs
- Login and Register 
- Unfinished main featuers: Add User, Generate Invoice, and User: View payment page for invoice
- Unfinished setup: Redux and testing

### Obstacles:
- Finding the time to work on this on a weekday
- Haven't used Django in a while, relearning the framework
